# sudoku-solver

## Description

This is a python script where I have used backtracking to solve a sudoku table.

## Installation
* no specific hardware needed
* no specific softwate needed

## Execution
* enter a preexisting sudoku table in a list format
* run the code. If it says "bad table", that would mean that the table if faulty.

## Concepts Used
* **Backtracking** is a general algorithm for finding solutions to some computational problem, that incrementally builds choices to the solutions, and rejects continued processing of tracks that would lead to impossible solutions. Backtracking allows us to undo previous choices if  they turn out to be mistakes.
